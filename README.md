# Machine-Learning
It is about Machine-Learning made by my classmate Jiayi Wu and me. This is my first time to do this. As a result, the depth of Machine-Learning may be restricted by my knowledge of Machine-Learning. Meanwhile, i accomplished many classic experiments combined with others' practice. Just try writing while learning.

Below are the contens of Machine-Learning.
